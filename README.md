### Approach Taken 
I knew that I wanted to build a fun and useful application. This idea started from when we were using express and thought about how I could use a 3rd party API to make finding the breweries even easier. There are not an exorbant amount of brewery API's, but I was able to find the one I used that was updated and listed thousands of breweries around the United States. My main take away from this project was time managament. I have struggled with it in the past, but having checkpoints and deliverables set was a big motivator. 

### Installation Instructions
```
git clone git@github.com:gititgrl/Beertender.git
```
```
npm install
```
### Technical Difficulties and Unsolved Problems
I was able to work through a lot of problems I came across working with React and the API because of past lectures and of course Stack Overflow, but there were a few that I could not get resolved in time.
- My brewery show page was unable to be completed. I could not display the data from the API that was mapped over in my Brewery List page. 
- Tailwind was incredibly frusturating at times. It was a learning curve of how to translate exactly what I wanted the page to look like to the long classNames needed to showcase it.
- Because of my struggles with tailwind, I do wish my styling was better. It is user friendly right now, but there isn't a *wow* factor that I wish I had for the application. Something to grow on!
